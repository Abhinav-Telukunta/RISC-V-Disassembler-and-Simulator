# RISC-V-Disassembler-and-Simulator

The project loads specified RISC-V text file consisting of binary instructions and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler).
Additionally, it also generates instruction-by-instruction simulation of the RISC-V code (simulator). It prints the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction.
